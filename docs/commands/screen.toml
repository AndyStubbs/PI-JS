name = "screen"
description = """
When the screen command is called it will create a canvas element and when graphics
commands are called they will manipulate the canvas created. There are three types
of canvas styles that can be created a fullscreen canvas that gets appended to the
body of the page, a canvas that gets appended to a container element supplied, or
an offscreen canvas.
<br /><br />
The screen command must be called before any graphics commands can be called.
<br /><br />
The aspect command allows certain types of screen resolutioins to be used. An x is
used to specify specific pixel dimensions of the screen. A : is used to provide a
aspect ratio. An e is to extend the canvas to fill 100% of the screen regardless of
aspect ratio. 
<br /><br />
Examples:<br />
300x200 = A canvas that has data for 300x200 canvas filled to fit in the screen dimensions with a 3:2 pixel ratio. <br />
16:9 = A canvas that has data and the maximum screen size for the 16:9 aspect ratio. <br />
640e480 = A canvas that tries to fit 640x480 resolution but will extend the data and 
the canvas size to fill the entire screen. <br />
<br />
If aspect is left blank then the canvas will fill the screen 100% width and height.
